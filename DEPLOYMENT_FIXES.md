# Deployment Fixes - Worker Timeout & Memory Issues

## Problem Summary

Your application was experiencing:

- **Worker Timeout**: Gunicorn workers timing out after 30 seconds (default)
- **Memory Issues**: AI models (Whisper + Edge TTS) consuming too much memory
- **SIGKILL**: Workers being killed due to memory constraints

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Gunicorn Configuration (`gunicorn.conf.py`)

- **Timeout**: Increased from 30s to 300s (5 minutes) for video processing
- **Workers**: Reduced to 1 worker to prevent memory conflicts
- **Memory Management**: Added RAM-based temp directory (`/dev/shm`)
- **Process Settings**: Optimized for memory-intensive operations

### 2. Memory Optimization in Code

- **Garbage Collection**: Added explicit `gc.collect()` calls at key points
- **File Cleanup**: Enhanced temporary file cleanup
- **Process Management**: Better resource management

### 3. Updated Procfile

- Now uses the custom Gunicorn configuration: `gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py run:app`

## Key Configuration Changes

```python
# Timeout settings
timeout = 300  # 5 minutes for video processing
graceful_timeout = 300

# Worker settings
workers = 1  # Single worker to avoid memory conflicts
worker_class = "sync"

# Memory optimization
worker_tmp_dir = "/dev/shm"  # Use RAM for temp files
max_requests = 1000  # Restart workers periodically
```

## Testing

Run the test script locally before deploying:

```bash
python test_gunicorn.py
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit Changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix worker timeout and memory issues"
   git push
   ```

2. **Monitor Deployment**:

   - Watch for worker timeout errors
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Check if video processing completes successfully

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - No more "WORKER TIMEOUT" errors
   - Video processing should complete within 5 minutes
   - Memory usage should be more stable

## Additional Recommendations

### For Production Scaling

If you need to handle multiple concurrent requests:

1. **Use a Queue System**: Implement Celery + Redis for background processing
2. **Separate Workers**: Run video processing in separate worker processes
3. **Load Balancing**: Use multiple instances behind a load balancer

### Memory Monitoring

Monitor your application's memory usage:

```bash
# Check memory usage
ps aux | grep gunicorn

# Monitor logs
tail -f your-app.log
```

### Environment Variables

Consider setting these environment variables:

```bash
export GUNICORN_TIMEOUT=300
export GUNICORN_WORKERS=1
export GUNICORN_MAX_REQUESTS=1000
```

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check Logs**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Monitor Memory**: Use `htop` or `top` to monitor memory usage
3. **Reduce Video Size**: Consider limiting upload file sizes
4. **Optimize Models**: Use smaller Whisper models if accuracy allows

## Success Indicators

✅ No "WORKER TIMEOUT" errors in logs
✅ Video processing completes successfully
✅ Memory usage remains stable
✅ No SIGKILL errors
✅ Users can upload and process videos without timeouts
