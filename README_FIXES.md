## Overview
This document outlines all the major fixes and improvements made to the NoProfanity project to resolve the issues you mentioned.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Transcription PDF Generation Issue
**Problem**: The transcription tool was generating text files instead of PDFs with poor formatting.

**Fix**:

  - Proper styling and layout

**Files Modified**:
- `python/others/transcription_analyzer.py` - Complete rewrite
- `requirements.txt` - Added ReportLab dependency

### 2. Video-Audio Merge Input Issue
**Problem**: The merge tool was only taking one input instead of two separate inputs for video and audio.

**Fix**:
- Completely redesigned `app/templates/video_audio_merge.html`
- Created separate upload areas for video and audio files
- Added proper file validation for both inputs
- Improved UI with clear visual distinction between video and audio uploads
- Enhanced JavaScript to handle two separate file inputs

**Files Modified**:
- `app/templates/video_audio_merge.html` - Complete redesign

### 3. Profanity Dashboard Issues
**Problem**: Poor layout and functionality in the profanity detection dashboard.

**Fix**:
- Completely redesigned `app/templates/profanity_count.html`
- Added comprehensive dashboard with:
  - Statistics cards showing key metrics
  - Interactive charts using Chart.js
  - Detailed profanity analysis table
  - Clean/error result displays
  - Responsive design for mobile devices

**Files Modified**:
- `app/templates/profanity_count.html` - Complete redesign

### 4. POS Tagging Integration
**Problem**: POS tagging was not properly linked and merged in the workflow.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced `python/text_processing/profanity_filter.py`
- Added proper NLTK integration with automatic downloads
- Implemented POS-aware profanity detection
- Created integration function to link POS tagger with workflow
- Added support for processing bad words datasets with POS tagging

**Files Modified**:
- `python/text_processing/profanity_filter.py` - Enhanced with POS integration
- `requirements.txt` - Added NLTK dependency

### 5. Dataset Linking Issues
**Problem**: Bad words dataset was not properly integrated with the project.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced profanity filter to properly load from `validated_profanity_replacements.csv`
- Added support for multiple dataset formats
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for missing datasets
- Added POS-aware dataset processing

**Files Modified**:
- `python/text_processing/profanity_filter.py` - Enhanced dataset integration

### 6. Requirements and Dependencies
**Problem**: Missing dependencies and version conflicts.

**Fix**:
- Updated `requirements.txt` with all necessary packages
- Added proper version specifications
- Included new dependencies for PDF generation and POS tagging

**Files Modified**:
- `requirements.txt` - Complete update
